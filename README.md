**turbine** distributes cryptocurrency to contributors of git repos.

### Not bug bounties!

Issue bounties can be counterproductive as they discourage collaboration and
often attract minimum-quality solutions.

Instead of rewarding specific contributions like bug bounties, **turbine**
reduces unfriendly competition by rewarding _all_ contributions alike. Multiple
authors can even work on the same issue and all get paid independently.

### Award amount scales over time rather than with change complexity

Although a complex change might deserve a larger award than a minor typo fix,
**turbine** doesn't factor the magnitude of changes. Instead, a developer's award
amount starts out small and increases over time as they make more contributions.
