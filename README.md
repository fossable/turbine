_crypto for commits_

**turbine** distributes cryptocurrency to contributors of git repos.

## Not like bug bounties!

- All contributions are paid, so unfriendly competition is reduced
- Cooperation is incentivized because all authors are awarded fairly

## Award amount scales over time rather than with change complexity

Although a complex change might deserve a larger award than a minor typo fix,
**turbine** doesn't factor the magnitude of changes. Instead, a developer's award
amount starts out small and increases over time as they make more contributions.
